    <h1>Chia-Wei Lin 林佳葦</h1>
    <p>I am an internaitonal student from Taiwan. I was born and grown in Taiwan until the age of 18. I study information system and techonology in application development at Bellevue College. My short term goal is to have good grade, learn as much as I can, and find at least two interships. And my long term goal is to find a job here and live here! I have a lot of hobbies. I like listening to music, watching movies and series in my free time.</p>
